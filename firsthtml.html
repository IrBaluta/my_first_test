    <h2>Introduction</h2>


    <p>Cats are territorial, 
        and coming into a new home leaves them 
        feeling really uneasy. There’s all that 
        unexplored space, and who knows what may l
        urk there. 
        <br>Do him a favor and provide a small 
        area to call his own for the first few days or 
        weeks. A bathroom or laundry room works well. 
        <br>the room with cat amenities, such as 
        food, water and a litter box. 
        You’ll want to 
        spend time with your cat, so make sure there’s a
         comfortable place for you to sit as well.</p>
